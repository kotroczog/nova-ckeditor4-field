### Changed
* Require Laravel Nova v4.0 within the composer.json which will then allow Nova 4 Support to be tagged properly for the CKEditor 4 field which it now supports.

### Fixed
* update dist/field.js - `npm run prod` was never ran with the default string for CKEditor.js, this corrects it with the correct field.js build.
  https://github.com/waynestate/nova-ckeditor4-field/commit/586d2ee3338b77c1ededbe2c2f4409106b6872ba This case would never have been met due to the merging of the configuration default for the package.

  Special thanks to @whchi who started this a while ago with #38 but never got put into the package.
